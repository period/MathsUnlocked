# MathsUnlocked

My A Level coursework project: a complete clone of a maths oriented online homework website. Supports grouping students and teachers into schools, bulk student creation from CSV files, QR code logins and randomly generated self-marking questions all built to be completely resistant to cheating from students unlike most online homework websites.


## Build Setup
Backend: located in ``api`` directory, all requests are handled by router.php.

Nuxt frontend:

```bash
# install dependencies
$ npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
$ npm run dev

# build for production and launch server
$ npm run build
$ npm run start

# generate static project
$ npm run generate
```
